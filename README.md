# static-website-2
#created by Kacper Karabinowski

This website was created using visual studio code, git and github. I also used figma to create a nice look design. I created a dot animation in background
during the page load. To do that I used some spans in HTML and @keyframes in css to animate them. There are also animations during the scroll website,
to do that u used simple JavaScript.
