          <h2>About me</h2>
          <p>
            Hi, I am a Full Stack Developer and Networking Specialist who has
            been interested in programming for 3 years. In my work as a Full
            Stack Developer, I strive to create web applications in accordance
            with the latest standards and trends. I am involved in designing and
            implementing both the frontend and backend of applications to ensure
            the best possible user experience.

          <h2>My projects</h2>
          <p>
            I have worked on various projects over the years, including a
            calculator in C#, a SIP server that is connected to VoIP through
            VPN, and a number guessing game. I have also developed a to-do list
            app, which has proven to be very useful in my personal and
            professional life. I am constantly seeking out new challenges and
            opportunities to further develop my skills as a Full Stack Developer
            and Networking Specialist.

          <h2>Why full stack?</h2>
          <p>
            I have always been fascinated by technology and the limitless
            possibilities it presents. As I began to explore the world of
            programming, I quickly discovered that being a Full Stack Developer
            would allow me to work with a variety of technologies and platforms,
            while also providing a deeper understanding of how applications are
            built from the ground up. With my interest in both frontend and
            backend development, I found that becoming a Full Stack Developer
            was the perfect fit for me. I enjoy being able to see the entire
            process of application development, from concept to deployment, and
            have found that the Full Stack approach allows for greater
            efficiency and collaboration throughout the development process.
            Additionally, I appreciate the opportunity to work on diverse
            projects and to constantly learn and adapt as new technologies
            emerge. Becoming a Full Stack Developer has allowed me to pursue my
            passion for programming in a meaningful and fulfilling way, and I
            look forward to continuing to develop my skills in this exciting
            field.
